supported the USAFE\/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool\nthat provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to\nthe GPC.\nThis tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the

card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of\nfunds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.\nI identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.\nMy research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and\nDFAS personnel.\nThis not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.\nI partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.\nI identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in\nFMSuite.\nBy utilizing Defense Connect Online

errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS\/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were\naccomplished.\nI also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.\nLimestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a\nDirectorate which previously did not exist.\nMy challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial\nreporting was maintained.\nAs we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.\nI participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.\nWorked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.\nI was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously\nexist.\nLimestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.\nIdentified suspense accounts not initially targeted,

provided initial progress towards meeting the Department of Treasury's mandate to discontinue suspense accounts by\nFebruary 2009.\nWorked with staff to reduce reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in\nexperienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.\nI orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS\nOmaha to Limestone.\nAfter transition to Limestone encouraged staff responsible for

employees.\nMy four first line supervisors were responsible for establishing priorities, schedules, and work assignments ensuring changes in workload are\naccounted for to minimize the impact on normal office operations.\nWe consistently reviewed these areas and made necessary personnel moves based on shifting priorities.\nThis was extremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard\nworkload.\nWorkload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.\nI also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes\nnegatively impacted our customers.\nIn December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.\nBy working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy\nthat included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of \"must pay now\" bills, and the formation of\nspecial action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.\nAs a result of these efforts, in a three month period, we were able to reduce our overaged invoice percentage by 19% and our backlog of\ndocuments to no documents over 20 days old thereby minimizing the adverse impact on customer funds.\nI was responsible for providing personnel feedback sessions quarterly and

these issues.\nUtilizing my expertise with Louis II data retrieval software, I produced ad-hoc data queries for in-house and external use by our customers.\nThese retrievals were designed to reduce the man- hours necessary to perform complex finance and accounting functions by DFAS and Air\nForce personnel.\nI was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.\nIn this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the\nmost cost efficient operation possible.\nI was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited to, vendors, DFAS management, accounting\nliaison offices, resource advisors, and other DFAS field sites.\nThese inquiries required my ability to relay technical aspects of systems deficiencies to customers who are not familiar with our operation.\nI participated in video teleconferences, conference calls, and briefings designed to address customer and DFAS management requirements.\nI was called upon to explain, in laymen's terms, DFAS policy and procedures with regards to delays in payment due to various reasons.\nI responded to various audit reports and studies; ensuring senior management and audit personnel, understand particular situations within the\nVendor Pay business process that result in these findings.\nCompany Name February 1999 to February 2000 Chief, Recon and Reports Branch \nCity , State\nIn my position as Chief, Vendor Pay Reports and Recon Branch, I exercised supervision (either

I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various\ndishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did\nnot keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at\nHoulihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my\nCulinary Career.

I feel like I\nam again coming to the point where I would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as I have done in the past at Sushi Time and The 5\nSpot.\nCompany Name City , State Dishwasher\/ Line Cook 04\/2014 to 10\/2014\nWorking at The 5 Spot was a really awesome experience for me. It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook\nexperience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for\na short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also\nposed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced\nneighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to\nstart all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to\nwork for my old boss again.\nCompany Name City , State Host, Server, Dishwasher, Cook 03\/2008 to 03\/2014\nSushi Time Towa is the first restaurant i have worked for. I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom\nand worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats,\ngrabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host\/server for\nabout a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the\nranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required\nto prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish\/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife\nskills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep\nconsisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-\n10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.\nI have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an\nenvironment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks.\nI've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over\ninventory; ranging from paper\/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the\ndifferent distributors and vendors we may use. My job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day,\nmaking sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. Im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may\nhave. Over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much. Ive matured so much through this job and sushi really\nhas become such a passion of mine. I am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my\nskill set and continue doing what i love. I have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. And I have no problem adjusting to any style or\ntraining. I will work any days\/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.\nEducational Background\nAssociate of Applied Science : Electrical-Computer Engineering 2012 Savannah Technical College , City , State , United States\nGED : General Education Wayne County Highschool , City , State , United States\nWayne County High school Grades 9-11 Glynn Adult Literacy program-GED\nSkills\n",

    "text":"DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMING ARTS\nProfessional Profile\nTech-savvy Performing Arts Director well-versed in all aspects of event management from inception to completion. Excels in marketing and talent\nprogramming, as well as process rethinking and improvement.\nQualifications\nProductivity improvement\nDetail-oriented\nSuperb time management skills\nProcess improvement\nMulti-unit operations management\nNatural leader\nUnsurpassed work ethic\nResults-oriented\nRelevant Experience\nIn my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU, I have\u00c2 drastically\u00c2 improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts\nCenter and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer\nSummer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016. By changing the way tickets are\nmarketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have\nalso\u00c2 created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016. I sought and\nobtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent improvements to the\naesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment. All of\nthis was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.\nExperience\n03\/2014 to Current\nDirector of Programming Arts Company Name \u00ef\u00bc\u200b City , State As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I am responsible for\nthe cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS)\nwhich has been the premier\u00c2 performing arts series in the area\u00c2 since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS\u00c2 and my duties\ninclude overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration,\u00c2 and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting\nwith and guiding the CCS\u00c2 Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host to\u00c2 a wide\nvariety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and\nCanadian Brass to name a few. I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner\nAmphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a\nhandful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements,\nincorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series\nformats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of music\u00c2 and marketed\nas a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an\nimportant, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion\nNational Park.\u00c2  The second series is\u00c2 an original show called, \"Sanctuary: The Story of Zion\" which was written to correspond with the\ncentennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and\ntech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be\nsupported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of\nvideo projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.\n01\/2010 to Current\nBoard of Directors Member Company Name \u00ef\u00bc\u200b City , State SUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern Utah area by providing a\nplatform for an active group of like-minded individuals interested in the art of songwriting and performance.
