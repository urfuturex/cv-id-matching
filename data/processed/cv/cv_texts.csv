Experience
Company Name July 2011 to November 2012 Accountant 
City , State
Enterprise Resource Planning Office (ERO)
In this position as an Accountant assigned to the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) ERO I was
responsible for identifying and resolving issues affecting the DEAMS General Ledger.
I worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered
with the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production.
I supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional
Management Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator.
In addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of
$360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.
These actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS
fiscal year-end requirements were completed.
These actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
(AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.
Company Name April 2010 to June 2011 Resource Advisor 
City , State
In this position as Resource Advisor for the 1st Air Communications Operation Squadron (1ACOS) I was responsible for providing
financial advice and decision support to the Commander.
I was responsible for coordinating a $4.6M budget between four funding sources.
I coordinated with USAFE Directorate of Intelligence (USAFE/A2), USAFE Directorate of Air and Space Operations (USAFE/A3),
USAFE Directorate of Communications (USAFE/A6) and the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing to ensure 1ACOS meets its mission
requirements.
I consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in
the required format for each organization.
I discussed the outcome of the Group and Directorate budget meetings providing feedback the same day to the Flight Chiefs and CC any
issue which affects 1ACOS directly.
I monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the
appropriate Reviewing Officials and Approvers.
Utilizing DTS and the General Accounting and Finance System I reviewed status reports to identify anomalies in obligations and have
identified those orders which require correction prior to payment.
I provided Government Purchase Card (GPC) status reports the same day they are requested and in addition, communicated with the
appropriate cardholders when changes were required to support their program.
I identified cardholder training requirements and monitored these requirements to ensure all required training was completed in support of
this mission critical program.
I developed guidance for the GPC cardholders on procedures for requesting training for the squadron and in addition I provided answers to
cardholder questions on unique or non-standard issues/concerns.

Company Name July 2008 to April 2010 Staff Accountant 
City , State
In my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to
customers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller.
I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific
weaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.
In collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the
accounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.
This tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.
I was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.
I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool
that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to
the GPC.
This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.
This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports
the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of
funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.
I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.
My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and
DFAS personnel.
This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.
I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.
I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in
FMSuite.
By utilizing Defense Connect Online I provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)
travel.

City , State
In my position as Chief of the Reports Branch in Accounts Maintenance & Control (AM&C) I was responsible for ensuring the
development and standardization of various managerial and system reports.
I was responsible for the completeness and accuracy of weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports.
My branch monitored errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were
accomplished.
I also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.
Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a
Directorate which previously did not exist.
My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial
reporting was maintained.
As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.
I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.
Worked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.
I was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously
exist.
Limestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.
Identified suspense accounts not initially targeted, formulated strategies to eliminate accounts or requested waivers, and participated in plans
to modify processes using suspense accounts, such as the interfund suspense account.
These actions provided initial progress towards meeting the Department of Treasury's mandate to discontinue suspense accounts by
February 2009.
Worked with staff to reduce reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in
experienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.
I orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS
Omaha to Limestone.
After transition to Limestone encouraged staff responsible for these reports to streamline the processes.

Company Name February 2000 to January 2007 Chief, Accounts Payable Branch 
City , State
As Chief Of Accounts Payable I was responsible for the overall management of a branch consisting of over 120 employees.
My four first line supervisors were responsible for establishing priorities, schedules, and work assignments ensuring changes in workload are
accounted for to minimize the impact on normal office operations.
We consistently reviewed these areas and made necessary personnel moves based on shifting priorities.
This was extremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard
workload.
Workload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.
I also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes
negatively impacted our customers.
In December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.
By working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy
that included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of ""must pay now"" bills, and the formation of
special action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.
As a result of these efforts, in a three month period, we were able to reduce our overaged invoice percentage by 19% and our backlog of
documents to no documents over 20 days old thereby minimizing the adverse impact on customer funds.
I was responsible for providing personnel feedback sessions quarterly and prepared supervisory appraisals of employees' performance and
potential for advancement.
Partnering with the management staff and employees, I was instrumental in establishing Employee Performance Plans that linked employee
performance to established DFAS Strategies and Balance Scorecard goals.

to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensure specific weaknesses have been corrected, and determine whether systemic or repeat
issues have been identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements, work processes, vendor pay system structures, and
data produced to resolve these issues.
Utilizing my expertise with Louis II data retrieval software, I produced ad-hoc data queries for in-house and external use by our customers.
These retrievals were designed to reduce the man- hours necessary to perform complex finance and accounting functions by DFAS and Air
Force personnel.
I was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.
In this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the
most cost efficient operation possible.
I was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited to, vendors, DFAS management, accounting
liaison offices, resource advisors, and other DFAS field sites.
These inquiries required my ability to relay technical aspects of systems deficiencies to customers who are not familiar with our operation.
I participated in video teleconferences, conference calls, and briefings designed to address customer and DFAS management requirements.
I was called upon to explain, in laymen's terms, DFAS policy and procedures with regards to delays in payment due to various reasons.
I responded to various audit reports and studies; ensuring senior management and audit personnel, understand particular situations within the
Vendor Pay business process that result in these findings.

Personal Information
Lakeland College Kirtland, OH, United States Although it is not a degree for the culinary field, I have been able to apply this degree to my career
and it has helped me along in my career obtain various management positions within the culinary field, which I have excelled in in my nine plus years
of this profession. My goal is to one day become an executive chef and I feel at this point I will reach it one day soon. Cooking has become a
strong passion of mine to where cooking jobs do not feel like jobs anymore, its more like a fun way to live my life day to day able to wake up
excited to go learn new cooking skills and make people excited about visiting our restaurant, well which ever one I am working in at the time. High
School Diploma: Culinary Arts (Vocational School at Beechwood High School) 2005 Charles F Brush Lyndhurst, OH, United States While
attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year
(12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various
dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did
not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at
Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my
Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an
opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able
to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.

Professional Experience
Chief Operating Officer 
June 2008 to January 2010 Company Name - City , State
Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.
May 1998 to May 2008 Company Name - City , State
COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.
In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the petty thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred. My
best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks to
my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months I had was when I sold 199 phones and over $3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet. Fulfilled all supervisory duties when Store Manager
was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them for
helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I am today.

Experience
Company Name City , State Sushi Chef 10/2014 to Current
Working at Wasabi's Downtown entailed the same tasks a sushi chef as Sushi Time, only I am now second chef instead of head chef. I feel like I
am again coming to the point where I would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as I have done in the past at Sushi Time and The 5
Spot.
Company Name City , State Dishwasher/ Line Cook 04/2014 to 10/2014
Working at The 5 Spot was a really awesome experience for me. It provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook
experience that I had not so much been exposed to at Sushi Time. I also started off at the dishwashing position here. Although I was only there for
a short period of time, the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that I had been missing in my culinary experience. It also
posed a challenge for me since I have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years. The 5 Spot was a highly fast-paced
neighborhood kitchen. So, you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must. I really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to
start all over from the bottom and work my way back up. I ended up leaving The 5 Spot due to constant management changes and an offer to
work for my old boss again.
Company Name City , State Host, Server, Dishwasher, Cook 03/2008 to 03/2014
Sushi Time Towa is the first restaurant i have worked for. I have been employed by Sushi Time for six years where I started at the very bottom
and worked my way to the top. I have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers, helping them to their seats,
grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face. I worked as a host/server for
about a year, so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi. In order for me to work my way up through the
ranks to sushi, I started at the very bottom in the dish pit. This consisted of me washing all dishes, pots, pans, and silverware. I was also required
to prep meats and veggies. Having started at the dish/prep position, these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife
skills as well. I then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work, but also cooking and frying all orders. Prep
consisted of cutting chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, and all types of veggies. I have been doing sushi now for 3 years. That is, Monday-Saturday 10-
10, give or take a few hours. I have had random days off here and there and some holidays, but for the most part 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.
I have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a person's face when they bite into the food and love it. I love being in an
environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what I do. Being a sushi chef at Sushi Time consists of a wide range of tasks.
I've received serve safe managerial training, so I am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code. I'm also in charge of going over
inventory; ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. This task also means I must handle all ordering trough the
different distributors and vendors we may use. My job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day,
making sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. Im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may
have. Over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by Towa, I have gained so much. Ive matured so much through this job and sushi really
has become such a passion of mine. I am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my
skill set and continue doing what i love. I have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. And I have no problem adjusting to any style or
training. I will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary.

containing secret North Carolina local ingredients. We had 8 hours to complete a 4 course meal enough for 150 guests. This was a great
personal experience.
I have worked full-time since I was 14.5 years old. Throughout college, I worked 40 hours weekly in the kitchen not including the 20 hours
average per week I would also bartend. I am an extremely hard worker and will get any job done. Working for world renown Executive

Office Manager/ Program Director 
April 2014 to Current Company Name ï¼​ City , State
The dojo I work at was sold to new owners in 2015; I stayed on board with the new owners and have improved many areas of their
business.
The biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.Â  The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them
$300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.Â  I came up with our own in house system.
I identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information
quickly.Â  I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.
We can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.
We were paying a lot for internet and phone.Â  I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.Â  I was able to
negotiate a great price and bundle our services.
We sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.Â  I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.Â  I
researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.Â  I was able to establish
new relationships and new pricing.
The dojo relocated in 2016.Â  When we took over a new space; I planned everything.Â  The bathroom remodel I came up with the
complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.
I handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.Â  In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our
doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.
Since working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.Â  I updated our facebook web page, came out
with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.
I have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in
advance.
I have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our
cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and
revamped our leadership program.
IÂ manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management,
ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.Â  I created
and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website

Summary
At the Culinary Institute of America, I was taught and mentored by an expert team of world renowned chefs and professors with outstanding
industry and education credentials. I gained extensive exposure and experience through the advanced culinary curriculum that is only offered at
CIA. My education went beyond memorizing and executing foods, cooking techniques and recipes - I learned how to analyze foods, how to adapt
them, and most important ... how to get creative with them. I am well trained in both classic and contemporary culinary methods and techniques
and developed a strong understanding of how to prepare a wide variety of global cuisines, as well as, wine & beer pairing.
I have had the opportunity to work with famed Chef Larry Forgione ""The Godfather of American Cuisine"" (father of Iron Chef Marc Forgione)
Learning the true practice of sourcing local ingredients into the restaurant known as farm-to-table cooking. I gained extensive hands-on experience
in CIA professional kitchens and bakeshops, and in their award-winning student-staffed restaurants (including the American Bounty Restaurant,
and Ristorante Caterina de' Medici, St. Andrews Restaurant). I gained both back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house experience under the
guidance of the expert faculty and through a 5 month externship at Walt Disney World's 3rd signature premier restaurant ""Artist Point"" in Orlando,
Florida at the Wilderness Lodge in Magic Kingdom. Additionally, I gained solid professional experience at Cattail Creek Country club in
Maryland, running the private catering businesses.

programming, as well as process rethinking and improvement.

Superb time management skills

Unsurpassed work ethic
Results-oriented
Relevant Experience
In my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU, I haveÂ drasticallyÂ improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts
Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer
Summer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016. By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have
alsoÂ created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016. I sought and
obtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent improvements to the
aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment. All of
this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.
Experience
03/2014 to Current
Director of Programming Arts Company Name ï¼​ City , State As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I am responsible for
the cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS)
which has been the premierÂ performing arts series in the areaÂ since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCSÂ and my duties
include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration,Â and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting
with and guiding the CCSÂ Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host toÂ a wide
variety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and
Canadian Brass to name a few. I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a
handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements,
incorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series
formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of musicÂ and marketed
as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an
important, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion
National Park.Â  The second series isÂ an original show called, ""Sanctuary: The Story of Zion"" which was written to correspond with the
centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and
tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be
supported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of
video projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.

management of a busy commercial recording studio. From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to creating production music that has
been featured on such networks as Discovery, Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with a talented staff of
creative minded engineers and musicians.Â  Spiral Studios has also been involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists
andÂ providing A/V equipment. Â In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.Â  These relationships have allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an entertainer as well as a
director.Â  This knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming. Â I continue to own
Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.

and processing chickens to fill the latest orders.Inside the farmhouse, I sat wide eyed watching my grandmother make what seemed like magic in
her big wooden bowl filling the orders for our family restaurant called Glisans .I credit my grandmother for instilling within me the passion for
savory and baking and using all of the chef senses! I have worked practically all of my life in some form within the hospitality world. I am very

The two subsystems communicate with the help of a trigger file.
This file indicates that a sending action has successfully completed and the data can be accessed on the receiving side.
If no trigger file is received on the target side, no processing take place.
